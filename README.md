# Overlap-based Masking Scheme

Masking schemes thend to be vital in various computer vision tasks, for the purpose of marking a particular region of interest we intend the algorithm to act upon. Here, we propose a labelled and a binary cuboidal masking scheme with the option of providing an overlapping factor for the sub-cuboids.
